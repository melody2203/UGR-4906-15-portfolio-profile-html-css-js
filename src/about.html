          Hi, I'm Merertu Philipose. I'm a web designer and developer with a
          passion for creating beautiful, functional websites. I am now pursuing
          a degree in software engineering at Addis Ababa University, where I
          have developed my programming and coding abilities using Python, Java,
          and JavaScript. In order to improve my skills, I also took a web
          development course from FreeCode Camp and Udacity. By working on
          numerous projects, I am now focusing on developing a profession in
          website design and development for a variety of users.I've worked on
          several fascinating projects and partnerships along the way, all of
          which have improved and developed my skill.<br />
          When I'm not working, you can probably find me taking pictures of
          nature, playing guitar, or sketching new designs.
