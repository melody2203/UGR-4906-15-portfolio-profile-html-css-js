          Hi, I'm Merertu Philipose. I'm a web designer and developer with a
          passion for creating beautiful, functional websites. I am now pursuing
          a degree in software engineering at Addis Ababa University, where I
          have developed my programming and coding abilities using Python, Java,
          and JavaScript. In order to improve my skills, I also took a web
          development course from FreeCode Camp and Udacity. By working on
          numerous projects, I am now focusing on developing a profession in
          website design and development for a variety of users.I've worked on
          several fascinating projects and partnerships along the way, all of
          which have improved and developed my skill.<br />
          When I'm not working, you can probably find me taking pictures of
          nature, playing guitar, or sketching new designs. I also have a strong
          passion for technology and am always experimenting with new tools,
          frameworks, and ideas that can help me improve my work, whether it's
          learning a new programming language, researching design trends, or
          testing out the newest technology.<br />
          Outside of the screen, I enjoy the excitement of exploration and
          adventure. Hiking in beautiful settings, seeing new locations, or
          sampling unusual foods are all ways that I enjoy exposing myself to
          diverse viewpoints and experiences. This attitude of adventure
          inspires me and keeps my mind open to new ideas in both my
          professional and personal life. I'm constantly thrilled to meet
          like-minded individuals, work with them on motivational initiatives,
          or investigate new prospects. Let's work together to build something
          incredible!
